//How to use predefined functions.
//This program uses the math functions pow and sqrt to determine
//and output the volume of a sphere, the distance between two 
//points, respectively, and the string function length to find 
//the number of characters in a string.
//If the radius of the sphere is r, then the volume of the sphere
//is (4/3)*PI*r^3. If (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are the coordinates of two 
//points in the XY-plane, then the distance between these points is 
//sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2).
